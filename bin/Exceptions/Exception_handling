 			Components:
 						1. try bock:This block encloses the code that might potentially throw an exception.
 						
 						2. catch block:This block immediately follows a try block and specifies how to handle
 						 	a particular type of exception if it occurs within the try block. Multiple 
 						 	catch blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.
 						 	
 						3.finally block: This block is optional and always executes, regardless of whether an 
 										exception occurred or was handled  
 										
 						4. throw keyword: This keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from within a method.
 						
 						5. throws keyword: This keyword is used in a method signature to declare that the method might throw certain types of checked exceptions. 
											This forces the calling method to either handle or re-declare these exceptions.
