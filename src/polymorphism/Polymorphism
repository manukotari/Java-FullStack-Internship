polymorphism : Many forms, Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
that allows objects to take on "many forms." In essence, it enables a single action to behave
differently based on the object performing

types of polymorphism: 1. compile time polymorphism : achived by method overloading while compile time.
			 it is static binding = the link between a function call and its specific definition is established at compile time, before the program even begins execution.
	   2. run time polymorphism : achived by method overriding while run time. 
	   		 it is dynamic binding = because the specific method to be executed is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.
